## Description

This Genesys Cloud Developer Blueprint demonstrates how to include the Genesys Cloud Javascript Platform SDK in a React app. This solution uses Typescript, although the implementation will be similar if you're using plain JavaScript. This solution includes a sample React app that explores use cases such as creating a profile page for a user and completing admin operations such as signing all the users out of a queue.
